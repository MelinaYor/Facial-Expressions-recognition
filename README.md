# Facial Expressions Recognition

This project aims to allow users to upload pictures and have a trained CNN model detect their emotions, such as ['Happy', 'Sad', 'Disgusted', 'Angry','Fearful', 'Surprised' , 'Neutral'].

A Jupyter Notebook will be uploaded soon with every step of the model training process explained.

## Getting Started

To get this project running, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Edit line 18 of the code to specify the directory of the model file. Make sure to use `\\` between every path component to avoid Unicode errors.
3. Run the Streamlit app by typing `streamlit run Facial_Expressions_Recognition.py` in your terminal.
4. Have fun!
5. Ah, before I forget haha -> Python is a `Must` -> Download Python from here :-> https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Future Updates

This was my first time trying to use a CNN and I got decent results, but there are still some problems that I need to fix. I may need a better dataset or try different approaches before updating this repository.

I will also try to fix the Streamlit problem that is stopping me from deploying this project.
